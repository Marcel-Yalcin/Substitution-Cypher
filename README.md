# Substitution-Cypher
Program encrypts text by assigning each character a number from a list of 10 distinct 3-digit numbers. It can also decrypt the text by checking each 3-digit number accross every list. 
With simple substitution cyphers, the message can be determined by analyzing the frequency of the replace character. By having 10 different option for each character, the message will be harder to crack.
